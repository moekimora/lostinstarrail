# Lost in Star Rail
Lost In Star Rail is a fan-made game inspired by Lost In Teyvat by SirFelpudo and Geoguessr

# How to Play
Your mission is to figure out where you are in the Star Rail Universe, place your pin on to Star Rail Map to make a guess by drag your cursor to the map and click on where you think was the correct location, after that, click Guess to see how well you did.
The maximum score you can get for each round is 5000, the farther you are to the correct place, the less score you get. 
If you guess in the wrong map location, you get 0 points.
